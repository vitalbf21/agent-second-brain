"""Pure parsing of `tmux capture-pane -p` output from an interactive
Claude Code session. No subprocess/tmux access — text in, value out.

Kept separate from claude_session.py so the fragile parsing logic is
fully unit-testable against real capture fixtures.

Design invariants (from live spikes + adversarial review):
* The model's answer markers are LINE-ANCHORED (each on its own line).
  The input echo shows the markers INLINE (mid-sentence), and the model
  quoting the marker syntax also appears inline. So matching only
  line-anchored markers distinguishes the real answer from the echo and
  from inline self-references — no fragile occurrence-counting needed.
* State signatures are matched only against the CHROME region (the bottom
  of the pane: footer/banner/idle line), never the whole transcript, so a
  reply that *mentions* "usage limit" or "/login" cannot be misclassified.

The rate-limit / logged-out signatures are not yet confirmed against a
live session and may need adjustment per CLI version (see tests, open Q #2).
